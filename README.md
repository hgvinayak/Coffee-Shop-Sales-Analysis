* For Tuesday , Saturday and Sunday - we will be having less sales so that we can avoid extra resources and materials.
* By looking at the prodcut category it is clear that only "COFEE", "TEA" and "BAKERY" categories are mostly contribuiting to the sales , so that we can look into other categories to improve them and also focus on these categories more with quality .
* We need to focus on "COFEE BEANS" and "BRANDED" category as the unit price is high but not much contribution is sales . So we can look at prices and what shall be the action.
* As the sales has been increased over the period and considering that the average no of transactions per day was 1178  and avg no of quantity per day was 1698 .
